    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180 ˚C.</li>
        <li>First prepare the meat ragout. Heat a little olive oil in a pan and fry 
            the finely chopped onion together with the carrot and celery.<br> 
            Sauté until the vegetables are soft and golden brown. It takes approximately 
            15 minutes. Add the garlic and rosemary and sauté for another two minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add both types of ground meat to the base and continue to cook until all 
            the juices have boiled off.<br> Pour half of the red wine over the mixture, 
            stir and cook for approximately 35 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Once the wine has boiled off, add the canned tomatoes and beef stock. 
            Cook uncovered for another 1.5 hours.<br> If necessary, add a little water
             to the mixture. Salt and pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>In the meantime, prepare the bechamel sauce. Put the milk in a medium 
            saucepan and add the bay leaf.<br> Cut the onion in two halves, stick cloves 
            into it and add it to the saucepan with the milk.<br> Bring the milk almost 
            to the boil and cook over a low heat for about 5 minutes. Leave to cool.
        </li>
        <li>In the second saucepan, prepare the roux. Melt the butter, add the flour and 
            saute for approximately 30 seconds, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.<br> 
            Take the prepared roux off the heat and add strained milk to it. 
            Stir until the flour is completely dissolved in the milk.
        </li>
        <li>Return the saucepan to the stove and cook, stirring constantly, 
            until the sauce thickens, about 4 minutes.<br> Reduce the heat to low and simmer 
            for approximately 20 minutes. Once the sauce is glossy and smooth, add 
            he nutmeg and season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Prepare a baking dish or a baking tray in which you will fold the individual layers.
             First, you need to cook the lasagna in salted water with a drop of oil.<br> 
             After a while, cool them with cold water to stop the "softening" process.
        </li>
        <li>Spread the prepared béchamel on the bottom of the baking dish, spread a layer 
            of lasagna on it and then add a layer of meat ragout.<br> Repeat the process until
             you have used all the ingredients. The last layer consists of lasagna, 
             tomato ragout and béchamel.<br> Finally, add grated Parmesan cheese to the béchamel 
             layer.
        </li>
        <li>Place the baking dish in the oven for 30-45 minutes. 
            The surface of the lasagna must be beautifully golden, but not burnt!
