    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly fry the chopped onion in butter in a saucepan. 
            Cover it with water or vegetable broth and add boiled potatoes cut into 
            small cubes with cumin, bay leaves and allspice.
        </li>
        <li>Once the onion softens a bit, add the sliced garlic (5 cloves). 
            Press the rest of the garlic and add it in the last minute of cooking so 
            that it retains as many vitamins as possible<br> and a strong flavor.
        </li>
        <li>Season as needed with marjoram, parsley or chives, pepper and salt. 
            Finally, as soon as you turn off the stove, add the garlic press and 1 beaten egg.
