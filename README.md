# odin-recipes

My First project with Odin

I've started with creating the "index.html" and fill it with the boilerplate HTML.

Then i've created "lasagna.html". I've put an image of lasagna on the page, then i've made
a basic description using paragraph.
I've made one unsorted and one sorted list on the page "lasagna.html" with ingredients and steps.
The i've created the link for "lasagna.html" on the homepage "index.html"
I've added two more pages with recipes and and linked them with homepage "index.html"

At the end i've polished the sites by adding the "odinre.png" logo as link to the homepage "index.html" and test inf the link is working on all pages.
